# Simple-MIPS-32-bits-Micro-Processor
In this repository I have implement in *Verilog* a reduced version of MIPS 32-bit processor, and may references to MIPS will be for 32-bit technology. 

MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) is a family of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architectures (ISA) developed by MIPS Computer Systems, now MIPS Technologies. 

## MIPS Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is the set of instructions that a computer processor can understand and execute. These instructions define the operations that the processor can perform, such as arithmetic, logical operations, data movement, etc.

* There are three Types (formats) of instruction in MIPS ISAs:
